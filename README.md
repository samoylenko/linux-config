# Linux config

Backup of my Linux config

## Arch linux

I am using Arch Linux as my primary operating system and Sway / XFCE as desktop
environment.

## Debian Testing with packages from Unstable

Before switching to Arch, I spent several years running Debian Testing and
Unstable. This config allows getting packages from Unstable and has extra
repositories configured (Docker, NodeJS, Metasploit, etc.)
