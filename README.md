# Linux config ARCHIVE

Backup of my Linux config files from the times when I could spare time to
maintain it.

I ended up running Arch Linux and Gnome as my primary OS and have never been
happier.

This repository comes from the times when I was still experimenting with Linux
desktop, and I loved Sway and XFCE, but in time I realized that I could not
afford to spend so much time configuring every tiny detail of my system.

However, I can certainly appreciate the freedom and possibilities offered by
Linux.

## The story so far

* My first Linux distribution in the early 2000s was Ubuntu (of course!).
* Around 2008-2010, I switched to Debian Stable but wasn't happy with outdated
  package versions.
* After some experimentation and crashes with Debian Sid (Unstable), I think I
  came up with an excellent combination of Debian Testing and Debian Unstable
  package injection where I needed. That's what I spent a lot of time using, and
  this config can be found in the `apt` dir in this repository.
* At some point in 2015-2017, I needed to reinstall my Debian for some reason,
  and I just wanted to try that Arch Linux distro everyone was talking about.
  The plan was to install it, try for maybe 10 mins and then erase the disk and
  install my usual Debian Testing+Unstable. I never came back from Arch to
  Debian.
